# telugu_treebank

IIIT Telugu treebank consisting of around 1600 sentences is made available in ICON 2009 tools contest. This treebank is combined with HCU Telugu treebank containing approximately 2000 sentences and another 200 sentences annotated at IIIT Hyderabad. We clean up the treebank by removing sentences with wrong format or incomplete parse trees etc. The final treebank consists of 3220 sentences. The treebank is annotated using Paninian dependency grammar. 
The intra-chunk dependencies are annotated using the treebank expander made available at https://github.com/ltrc/Shift-Reduce-Chunk-Expander based on Context Free Grammar (CFG) rules for Telugu. The grammar file for Telugu is made available.
The treebank is made available in both SSF and CoNLL-X format.
